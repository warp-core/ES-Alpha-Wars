	description "The Javelin Pod fires a rapid stream of unguided missiles. A Javelin Pod does far more damage than any gun of a comparable size, and has a longer range as well, but once a ship has fired off all its ammunition it must leave combat and find a planet where it can buy more, which makes Javelins less useful in protracted battles. As a result, they are very popular with pirates as a way to quickly disable a small target."

Gatling invented his early rapid fire gun in the mid-19th century, he called it "Peacemaker", convinced that it was so destructive that no government would ever send people to face them again. Over a millennia (and hundreds of wars) later, the basic design is still used, a testament to its fundamentally robust design (and the inability of guns to prevent wars). While capable of a fairly quick rate of fire, this gun needs to cool down for twice as much time as it fires, and can only sustain a maximum of three seconds of continuous fire.`
